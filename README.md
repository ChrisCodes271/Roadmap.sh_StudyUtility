# Roadmap.sh_StudyUtility
A short quiz based study utility inspired by the open source learning project Roadmap.sh

Hello! Welcome to the Roadmap.sh study utility. 

For those that are not aware, Roadmap.sh is a community created guide for educational content that I have found extremely useful in my coding journey. 
While working through some of the curriculum I decided to develop an application that will help those on their journey to becomming a better programmer.


In order to facilitate better knowledge retention, the Roadmap.sh study utility challenges you in the form of short quizzes. 
Users can create their own database and input their own questions to craft a more personalized experience, or share quiz banks between eachother.
